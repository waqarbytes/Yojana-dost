Build a futuristic, animated, and mobile-responsive web portal called Yojana Dost, inspired by the Indian Government’s UMANG portal (https://web.umang.gov.in/landing/), using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

✅ Do not use React, Angular, or any backend language or database.
✅ Each page must have its own HTML, CSS, and JS files (no global CSS or single-page app logic).

📄 Required Pages:
index.html – Landing page with animations and scheme search

schemes.html – List view with filtering and categories

categories.html – Browse schemes by category (Health, Women, Farmers, etc.)

state-schemes.html – Select Indian states and view respective schemes

grievance.html – Complaint form (mock submit)

contact.html – Name, email, message form

about.html – Overview of the portal

chatbot.html – Fullscreen chat assistant

💬 Chatbot Assistant Requirements:
Add a floating chatbot widget to the bottom-right of every page (except chatbot.html which should be full screen).

The chatbot:

Should be toggleable (open/close)

Should use a pure JavaScript-based rule engine

Must be trained with up to 400 real Indian government schemes

Must load the Q&A pairs from a JSON file (like data/schemes.json)

Must support exact match and keyword-based fuzzy search

🧠 Example Bot Flow:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "pmay": "PMAY (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana) is a housing scheme for urban and rural poor.",
  "pm-kisan": "PM-KISAN provides financial aid of ₹6000 per year to eligible farmers.",
  "digital india": "Digital India is a campaign to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy.",
  ...
}
If user types: "Tell me about PMAY" → match pmay and show the reply.

If user types: "what scheme is for students" → match keyword students and return schemes like NSP, scholarships.

If no match: reply "❓ Sorry, I couldn't find that. Please rephrase or explore schemes."

✨ Visual Requirements:
Modern animations, smooth transitions, hover effects

Clean and futuristic design (glassmorphism, neumorphism, or soft UI)

Use Google Fonts, icons, and responsive layout
