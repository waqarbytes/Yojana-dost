Build a full-featured web portal called "Yojana Dost" using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no React, Vue, Angular, or backend).

The portal should replicate all key features and sections of UMANG web app, with a futuristic UI and full chatbot integration. Each page must have its own separate HTML, CSS, and JS files. No global styles or frameworks.

📑 Pages to Include (Same as UMANG):
index.html – Hero section, banner, featured services (UMANG landing clone)

schemes.html – List/search/filter central + state government schemes

categories.html – Browse by scheme types: Health, Farmers, Education, Women, Pension, etc.

state-schemes.html – Dropdown + grid of state-wise schemes

grievance.html – Complaint/feedback form with name, mobile, and Aadhaar

services.html – UMANG services view (like DigiLocker, EPFO, CSC, etc.)

my-profile.html – Static profile page layout (mock user data)

about.html, contact.html, terms.html, faq.html – Informational pages

chatbot.html – Full page dedicated to the chatbot UI

🧠 Chatbot Assistant (On Every Page)
A floating chatbot widget must appear on all pages

Built using pure JavaScript only (no external API)

Uses a local schemes.json file containing ~400 real Indian government schemes with:

Title

Short description

Keywords (for fuzzy matching)

Chatbot should:

Auto-suggest answers based on fuzzy matching

Match partial or exact queries

Work offline — no server/API calls

Style it using chatbot.css, functionality in chatbot.js

🔧 Example Chatbot Behavior:

{
  "pmay": {
    "title": "Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana",
    "description": "Affordable housing for urban and rural poor under PMAY scheme.",
    "keywords": ["housing", "home", "pmay", "urban", "rural"]
  },
  "pm-kisan": {
    "title": "PM-KISAN",
    "description": "₹6000 per year income support to eligible farmers.",
    "keywords": ["farmers", "kisan", "support"]
  }
}
User types: "What is pmay" → Response: description for PMAY

User types: "I need help for farmers" → Match farmers → Response: PM-KISAN

Unknown query → Response: “❓ Sorry, I couldn't find that. Please rephrase or explore schemes.”

✨ Design Requirements:
Futuristic visual style (glassmorphism, neumorphism, or soft UI)

Mobile-friendly and responsive

Use icons, Google Fonts, and smooth animations

All pages must be well-commented, organized into folders:
